# ObjectStore Reference Application
ObjectStore reference application is built to showcase the method of developing a multi-cloud based application using a single-code line.

## Description
Using this reference application you can build a multi-cloud application, which can be run on SAP Cloud Platform consuming ObjectStore service with different IaaS providers underneath - e.g. AWS, GCP, OpenStack, Azure. The focus is on single-code line thereby making the application portable across different cloud providers. A java based open source library called [jclouds](https://jclouds.apache.org/) is used to abstract out the differences between different IaaS specific SDKs and provide simplified and portable APIs to develop a multi-cloud application.

The application uses jclouds 2.1.2. At present, the application supports objectstore service from three different IaaS providers namely: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage(GCS) and OpenStack Swift.

Following jclouds dependencies are used in the application.

~~~
    <!-- jclouds dependencies -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.jclouds.provider</groupId>
      <artifactId>aws-s3</artifactId>
      <version>${jclouds.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.jclouds.provider</groupId>

      <artifactId>openstack-keystone</artifactId>
      <version>${jclouds.version}</version>
    </dependency>
~~~
The size of each of the jclouds dependencies are as follows: 
~~~
    Dependency                Size
    -------------             -------
    aws-s3                    29kb
    google-cloud-storage      158kb
    openstack-swift           137kb
    openstack-keystone        294kb
~~~

Besides spring-boot and jclouds the other dependencies used in the application are: 

•	jackson-databind: to parse json file

•	guava: to build BlobStoreContext and to convert input stream to byte array 

•	commons-fileupload: to upload files 

For more information about the dependencies please refer the [pom](./pom.xml).

#### Application Use case

•	The application creates RESTful endpoints to upload, download, delete and list files.

•	The application then uploads the files to the Object Storage service. In background, JClouds library abstracts to the code to upload the different providers like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, OpenStack Swift.

## Download and Installation

#### Build the Application
[Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the application `objectstore-sample` to your system

Clone URL :  `https://github.wdf.sap.corp/refapps/objectstore-sample.git`
Navigate to the root folder of the application and run the below maven command to build the application:
```
mvn clean install
```

#### Deploy the Application on Cloud Foundry

  1. Logon to the Cloud Foundry environment using the following commands on the command prompt:
     ```
     cf api <api>
     cf login
     ```
     `api` - [URL of the Cloud Foundry landscape](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/350356d1dc314d3199dca15bd2ab9b0e.html) that you are trying to connect to.
        
     Enter username, password, org and space when prompted to. For more information on the same refer [link](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/75125ef1e60e490e91eb58fe48c0f9e7.html#loio4ef907afb1254e8286882a2bdef0edf4).
    

  2. Create the Cloud Foundry ObjectStore Service Instance

     - To run the application on AWS landscape, create a service by executing the below command:

       `cf create-service objectstore s3-standard objectstore-service`

     - To run the application on GCP landscape, create a service by executing the below command:

       `cf create-service objectstore gcs-standard objectstore-service`
        
     - To run the application on OpenStack landscape, create a service by executing the below command:

       `cf create-service objectstore swift-standard objectstore-service`

      > Important: <b>*Please don't change the service instance name i.e. `objectstore-service`*</b>

  3. Edit manifest.yml file. Replace the `<unique_id>` placeholder with your *SAP User ID* so that the host name is unique in the CF landscape. You can find your *SAP User ID* in [your sap.com profile](https://people.sap.com/#personal_info).

#### Test the Application

[Postman Client](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) can be used to test / access the REST API endpoints.

Replace the `<application URL>` placeholder in the below steps with the URL of the application you deployed. 

##### Upload a file / object

<b>POST</b>

To upload a file / object set the below request body and hit the endpoint url.

EndPoint URL :   `<application URL>/objectstorage.svc/api/v1/storage/`

Request Body : form-data with key-value pair. Pass the name of the key as `file` and the value is `the path of the file`.

> For the file upload, we have provided a [test file](/documents/test.rtf) in the documents folder which you can use if needed for the upload testing.

## How to Obtain Support

In case you find a bug, or you need additional support, please open an issue here in GitHub.

## Known Issues
- BlobStore removeBlob() api does not work in Jclouds OpenStack Swift and a bug is reported to jclouds team. For more information see [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCLOUDS-1483).
- Multipart Upload feature is not supported in jclouds OpenStack Swift and a bug is reported to jclouds team. For more information see [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCLOUDS-1482).
- Using InpuStream instead of ByteArray to upload large files to make the read operation faster causes issues. For more information see [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCLOUDS-1451). 

## TO-DO
- To provide support for Azure ObjectStore
